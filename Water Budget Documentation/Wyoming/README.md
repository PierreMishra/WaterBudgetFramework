# Wyoming 

Wyoming has a separate surface and groundwater model. We'll focus on the surface water model.

The basic model is a [spreadsheet model](http://waterplan.state.wy.us/plan/bear/2011/models/2011_BearModels.zip). The spreadsheet model produces estimates of Inflows, Diversions, and Outflows. However, this relies on upstream estimates of a variety of consumptive uses, which drive the estimates of diversions and return flows. Thus, the entirety of the model is described on [this page](http://waterplan.state.wy.us/plan/bear/2011/report.html)
