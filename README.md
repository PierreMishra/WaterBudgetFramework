# IoW Water Budget Framework

This is the repository describing the Water Budget Framework (WBF) project. A Water Budget (sometimes called Water Account or Water Balance) is ["...an accounting of the rates of water movement and the change in water storage in all or parts of the atmosphere, land surface, and subsurface."](https://water.usgs.gov/watercensus/AdHocComm/Background/WaterBudgets-FoundationsforEffectiveWater-ResourcesandEnvironmentalManagement.pdf)

Of course, there are many many ways to produce such an accounting. Where these ways differ is not merely an academic exercise in accuracy. Water budget estimates can have legal and political consequences as different jurisdictions.
The WBF projis a mapping of

2. USGS [Colorado River Basin Specifically](https://www.usgs.gov/mission-areas/water-resources/science/colorado-river-basin-focus-area-study?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects)
3. Utah DWR [Water Budget Model](https://www.westernstateswater.org/utah-division-of-water-resources-water-budget-program-methods-description/)
4. New Mexico [Dynamic Statewide Water Budget](https://nmwrri.nmsu.edu/new-mexico-dynamic-statewide-water-budget/)
5. Colorado [StateWB](https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdss/statewb)
6. Australia [National Water Accounts](http://www.bom.gov.au/water/nwa/2018/)

The documentation describing each of this water budgeting frameworks are in the folders in this repository. Some water budegting frameworks are integrated models that run on one computer program (e.g. Utah, Colorado). Some are ensemble models (e.g. California, New Mexico)

## Ontology

The intermediate product will be an ontology. Watch this video for a brief into to ontologies.
